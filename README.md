SwiftRichString is a lightweight library which allows to create and manipulate attributed strings easily both in iOS, macOS, tvOS and even watchOS.
It provides convenient way to store styles you can reuse in your app's UI lements, allows complex tag-based strings rendering and also includes integration with Interface Builder.

If you manipulate `NSAttributedString` in Swift, SwiftRichString allows you to keep your code manteniable, readable and easy to evolve.

## Features Highlights

### Easy Styling
The main concept behind this lib is the `Style`: a style is just a collection of text attributes you can apply to a string. The following example show how to create a style an produce an attributed string with it:

```swift
let style = Style {
	$0.font = SystemFonts.AmericanTypewriter.font(size: 25) // just pass a string, one of the SystemFonts or an UIFont
	$0.color = "#0433FF" // you can use UIColor or HEX string!
	$0.underline = (.patternDot, UIColor.red)
	$0.alignment = .center
}
let attributedText = "Hello World!".set(style: style) // et voil√†!
```

### Global Styles & Interface Builder Integration
Styles can be also registered globally and reused in your app.
Just define your own style and register using `Styles.register()` function:

```swift
let myStyle = Style { // define style's attributes... }
Styles.register("MyStyle", style: style)
```

Now you can reuse it everything in your app; SwiftRichString exposes a `styleText` property for the most common text containers and you can set it directly in Interface Builder:

### Complex Rendering with tag-based strings
SwiftRichString allows you to render complex strings by parsing text's tags: each style will be identified by an unique name (used inside the tag) and you can create a `StyleGroup` which allows you to encapsulate all of them and reuse as you need (clearly you can register it globally).

```swift
// Create your own styles

let normal = Style {
	$0.font = SystemFonts.Helvetica_Light.font(size: 15)
}
		
let bold = Style {
	$0.font = SystemFonts.Helvetica_Bold.font(size: 20)
	$0.color = UIColor.red
	$0.backColor = UIColor.yellow
}
		
let italic = normal.byAdding {
	$0.traitVariants = .italic
}

// Create a group which contains your style, each identified by a tag.
let myGroup = StyleGroup(base: normal, ["bold": bold, "italic": italic])
		
// Use tags in your plain string	
let str = "Hello <bold>Daniele!</bold>. You're ready to <italic>play with us!</italic>"
self.label?.attributedText = str.set(style: myGroup)
```

That's the result!

### What's `Style`/`StyleGroup` and how to use them

A `Style` is a class which encapsulate all the attributes you can apply to a string. The vast majority of the attributes of both AppKit/UIKit are currently available via type-safe properties by this class.

Creating a `Style` instance is pretty simple; using a builder pattern approach the init class require a callback where the self instance is passed and allows you to configure your properties by keeping the code clean and readable:

```swift
let style = Style {
	$0.font = SystemFonts.Helvetica_Bold.font(size: 20)
	$0.color = UIColor.green
	// ... set any other attribute
}
```

`Style` instances are anonymous; if you want to use a style instance to render a tag-based plain string you need to include it inside a `StyleGroup`. You can consider a `StyleGroup` as a container of `Styles` (but, in fact, thanks to the conformance to a common `StyleProtocol`'s protocol your group may contains other sub-groups too).

```swift
let bodyStyle: Style = ...
let h1Style: Style = ...
let h2Style: Style = ...
let group = StyleGroup(base: bodyStyle, ["h1": h1Style, "h2": h2Style])
```

The following code defines a group where:

- we have defined a base style. Base style is the style applied to the entire string and can be used to provide a base ground of styles you want to apply to the string.
- we have defined two other styles named `h1` and `h2`; these styles are applied to the source string when parser encounter some text enclosed by these tags.

## How to use styles globally with `StyleManager`
Styles can be created as you need or registered globally to be used once you need.
This second approach is strongly suggested because allows you to theme your app as you need and also avoid duplication of the code.

To register a `Style` or a `StyleGroup` globally you need to assign an unique identifier to it and call `register()` function via `Styles` shortcut (which is equal to call `StylesManager.shared`).

In order to keep your code type-safer you can use a non-instantiable struct to keep the name of your styles, then use it to register style:

```swift
// Define a struct with your styles names
public struct StyleNames {
	public static let body: String = "body"
	public static let h1: String = "h1"
	public static let h2: String = "h2"
	
	private init { }
}
```

Then you can:

```swift
let bodyStyle: Style = ...
Styles.register(StyleNames.body, bodyStyle)
```

Now you can use it everywhere inside the app; you can apply it to a text just using its name:

```swift
let text = "hello world".set(StyleNames.body)
```

or you can assign `body` string to the `styledText` via Interface Builder designable property.
